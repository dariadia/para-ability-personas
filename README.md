### What

👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 Para-ability Personas is an API employed in [the Para-ability Personas Project](https://danni-s-folio.vercel.app/projects/para-ability-personas) showcased on 🌿[Danni's Folio](https://github.com/dariadia/danni-s-folio) alias my personal portfolio. 

#### Inspired by:

-  [this article](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2019/02/11/using-persona-profiles-to-test-accessibility/) on using 🧑‍🦯 persona profiles to test accessibility,
- and [this survey](https://www.abilitynet.org.uk/news-blogs/less-1-website-home-pages-are-likely-meet-accessibility-standards) 📊 which found out that less than 1% of website home pages are likely to [meet accessibility standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/),
- and my own morals 🦸🏽 ...

##### ⚡️ I set out to create sample profiles on para-abilities for web-developers 🧑‍💻 and interested persons 💁.

#### Including 🧑‍🦼
- 🩺 short info on the para-ability,
- 🙋 general advice on how to approach the person,
- 💻 advice for web-developers to improve their site experiences.

#### Presenting
- 🧏 persons with their own stories 🧑‍🦽

#### 🙋 Why ⁉️

Simply put:
- personas feel _real_ ✨

You would meet a person who faces certain barriers. You would get to know them, and then receive advice on how to make your own project a better place for this person. 
⭐️ Imagine your new friend scrolling through your pages. Nagivating, taking in the information presented. _Can_ they...?
